Pseudo-Code

1. What is the problema to be solved?
    - Find the area of the shaded region.
2. What do I know?
    - I know that the circles are all the same size
    - The squares vertices are located at the center of the four circles
    - The Cost of a bushel of soybeans (not really relevant right now)
    - The estimate cost of the new irrigation system ( again, not super relevant)

3. What can I visualize about the problem?

    - I can draw four circles and make a square from all the of the center points and see what shaded region is being spoken of.

4.What do I need from the user?
    - I need the radius of one of the circles

5. What will my program produce?
    - My program will produce the area of the shaded region

6. Line-by-Line description of what the program needs to do:
    - Get the radius of a circle from the user
    - Store that in a variable
    - Calculate the area of the circle by using the equation ( A = PI * r^2 )
    - Calculate the area of the square using the equation ( A = length * width)
    - Minus the area of the square from the area of the circle to find the shaded region
    - Output the area of the shaded region back to the user.
7. Test Values:
    - 5
    - 0
    - 13
    - (-1)


Questions:

#1. A - as you think about the way that your program should work.
#2. A - as you think about the way that your program should work.
