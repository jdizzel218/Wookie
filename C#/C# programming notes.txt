C# Programming Notes 

//init
'''
Programs consist of only three things:
	1. variables - store things
	2. methods - do things (behavior)
	3. objects - are things to be acted upon.
'''
//Definitions
orphan - an object whose reference has been lost.

//Notes
I. Value-Type (light weight objects)
	a. Each variable is a bucket that is a certain size and shape.
	b. int - size: 32 bits ( or 4 bytes), shape: integer, value: ? (? = garbage).
		1. Garbage in => Garbage out.
	c. double - size: 64 bits(8 bytes), shape: floating point, value: ?.
	d. char   - size: 16 bits(2 bytes), shape: Unicode character
	e. bool   - size: 8 bits(1 byte),  shape: integer

II. Reference-Type (Regular objects)
	a. string - size: 32 bits(4 bytes), shape: object, value: ?
	b. console
	c. math 

III. Variables
	a. 2 types: constant and variable
	b. const - after initialization, cannot change value of variable.
IV. Programs and Data
	a. Data 
		1. Central to the idea of how a program works
		2. Every program that is ever written does something to data
		
	b. Simple Data Types
	c. Variables and constants
	d. Declarations - when we declare variables
	e. Assignment - assignment operator = ( '=' )
	f. Input and Output - writing and reading respectively.
	g. Style - helps give a regular way of writing code to help make code readable.

I. Identifiers 
	A. (int iData = 32); an identifier is the name of the variable. It contains the 'address' in 
	   	memory that the computer uses to find the data the variable references to.

	B. Must begin with either a letter or an underscore character i.e [a-z, A-Z, _ ], the remaining
		characters may be letters, digits, or the underscore character [ a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _], they
		can also have any length. They are case-sensitive.

Went over Lab 2 today in class.

I. Flow of control
	A. the order in which the statements in a program are executed
	B. if the "if statement"  resolves to TRUE then do something... If it's FALSE then do this... OTHERWISE do this...
	C. Four types of flow-control:
		1. if
		2. if-ese
		3. ?:
		4. switch
	D. $ - String interpelator (Converts value of variables to strings on the fly)

//Reviewed Conditionals - if statements.

I. Common Registrers
	A. EAX - (a stands for accumulator)
	B. EBX - (a was already used so they used b instead.)
	C. ECX
	D. EDX
	E. When processors were 16bits they were called a,b,c,d. When they were 32bits they called them ax,bx,cx,dx
		and now that processors are 64bits, they called them eax, ebx,ecx,edx.

//Covered expressions, operators, and logical(boolean) operators.

I. Type Casting
	A. casting is used to explicitly converts from one data type to another. Casts do both
		widening and narrowing conversions. (Up-Casting and Down-Casting)

II. Operation Precendence
	A. *, / has more presedence than +,-

III. The String Class
	A. Strings can be concatenated (added together) using the + operator (think of it as being a gluestick.)
	B.
