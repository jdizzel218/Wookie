C# Programming Notes 

//init
'''
Programs consist of only three things:
	1. variables - store things
	2. methods - do things (behavior)
	3. objects - are 
'''
//Definitions
orphan - an object whose reference has been lost.

//Notes
I. Value-Type (light weight objects)
	a. Each variable is a bucket that is a certain size and shape.
	b. int - size: 32 bits, shape: integer, value: ? (? = garbage).
		1. Garbage in => Garbage out.
	c. double - size: 64 bits, shape: floating point, value: ?.
	d. char   - size: 16 bits, shape: Unicode character
	e. bool   - size: 8 bits,  shape: integer

II. Reference-Type (Regular objects)
	a. string - size: 32 bits, shape: object, value: ?
	b. console
	c. math 

III. Variables
	a. 2 types: constant and variable
	b. const - after initialization, cannot change value of variable.
IV. Programs and Data
	a. Data 
		1. Central to the idea of how a program works
		2. Every program that is ever written does something to data
		
	b. Simple Data Types
	c. Variables and constants
	d. Declarations - when we declare variables
	e. Assignment - assignment operator = ( '=' )
	f. Input and Output - writing and reading respectively.
	g. Style - helps give a regular way of writing code to help make code readable.

I. Identifiers 
	A. (int iData = 32); an identifier is the name of the variable. It contains the 'address' in 
	   	memory that the computer uses to find the data the variable refernces to.

	B. Must begin with either a letter or an underscore character i.e [a-z, A-Z, _ ], the remaining
		characters may be letters, digits, or the underscore character [ a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _], they
		can also have any length. They are case-sensitive.
